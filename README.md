# Business_Analysis_IBM
Our four-person team has conducted a business analysis on the IBM Employee Attrition data and has offered some reasonable alternatives depending on the existing situation. Our primary goal in this project was to visually represent the effects of various factors on the attrition count in order to critically analyze the causes behind the company's high attrition rate and offer some easily implementable and financially advantageous business alternatives.
